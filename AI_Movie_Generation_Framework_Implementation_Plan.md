## 3. Agent Communication Protocol
- Define message format:
  - Message ID: Unique identifier for the message.
  - Sender: Name of the agent sending the message.
  - Receiver: Name of the agent receiving the message.
  - Message Type: Type of message (request, response, update).
  - Content: The actual content of the message.
  - Context: Information about the scene, previous assets, and constraints.
  - Metadata: Additional information such as timestamp, priority, and dependencies.

- State management example:
  - ProjectState class to manage scenes, characters, assets, context history, and generation queue.

## 4. Workflow Example
1. User Input → Controller Agent
2. Controller → Analysis Agent (determine video type)
3. Analysis → Story Development Agents (create content)
4. Story Development → Visual Generation Agents (create visuals)
5. Parallel: Story Development → Audio Generation Agents (create audio)
6. All components → Quality Control Agents
7. Quality Control → Controller → User

## 5. Asset Management System
- Hierarchical storage, metadata tagging, version control, and context preservation.

## 6. Implementation Considerations
### 6.1 Scalability
- Microservices architecture, queue-based communication, distributed processing.

### 6.2 Error Handling
- Graceful degradation: Ensure the system continues to function at a reduced capacity in case of failures.
- Automatic retry mechanisms: Implement retries for transient errors.
- User feedback loops: Collect user feedback to improve error handling.

### 6.3 Security
- Asset encryption: Encrypt sensitive assets to protect against unauthorized access.
- Access control: Implement role-based access control for different agents.
- API authentication: Use OAuth or JWT for secure API access.

### 6.4 Performance Optimization
- Caching mechanisms: Use Redis or similar for caching frequently accessed data.
- Parallel processing: Leverage multi-threading or asynchronous processing for intensive tasks.
- Resource allocation: Dynamically allocate resources based on workload.

## 7. Enhanced Workflow Integration
- Pipeline orchestration and genre-specific workflows.

## 8. Advanced Asset Management
- 3D asset pipeline: Manage 3D models, textures, and animations.
- Multi-format support: Support for 2D assets, 3D models, audio files, visual effects, and physics simulations.

## 9. Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Core Framework
- Basic agent infrastructure and simple 2D video generation.

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- 3D capability integration and genre specialization.

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- Machine learning improvements and real-time rendering.

## 10. Quality Assurance System
### 10.1 Technical QA
- Performance benchmarking: Measure rendering times and resource usage.
- Output quality metrics: Assess visual and audio quality against predefined standards.

### 10.2 Creative QA
- Story coherence: Ensure the narrative flows logically.
- Visual consistency: Check for style and color consistency across scenes.

## 11. Resource Management
### 11.1 Compute Resources
- GPU allocation: Monitor and allocate GPU resources for rendering tasks.
- Rendering farm management: Manage a cluster of machines for distributed rendering.

### 11.2 Asset Resources
- Template library: Maintain a library of reusable templates for various assets.
- Sound libraries: Curate a collection of sound effects and music tracks for use in projects.
